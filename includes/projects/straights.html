                    The Straights game was created as the final project for CS246 Object-Oriented Software Development.
                    The game is made using C++, uses object-oriented programming principles, and made careful
                    considerations of design patterns. The game also employs proper use of memory management and error
                    handling.
                    <br><br>
                    As part of the final project, I also created a UML diagram to describe the relationship between
                    classes, a demo to walk through the different features, and a design document to describe the
                    various design decisions.
