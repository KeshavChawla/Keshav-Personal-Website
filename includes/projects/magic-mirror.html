                <p class="card-text">
                    In July of 2017, I stumbled across photos and videos online of people making mirrors that could
                    present a dashboard of widgets ranging from daily weather to any traffic delays.
                    <br><br>
                    I set out to build my own in the process using tutorials online and based on the MagicMirror²
                    platform run on Electron.
                    Everything is powered through a Raspberry Pi 3 and hooked up to a 32 inch TV behind a two-way
                    mirror.
                    <br><br>
                    In the process, I was able to work with PubNub's Functions, Integrating Google's Assistant Voice in
                    the mirror, MagicMirror²'s software, and Canadian news RSS feeds.
                    <br><br>
                    I am continuosly improving this project and adding/modifying features to my mirror. Just recently, I
                    was able to use the RPiPlay repository to add Airplay functionality to the mirror.
                    In addition to the default view, the mirror is able to mirror my phone screen or "cast" a movie from
                    my phone to watch on the mirror.
                    <br><br>
