                    InsureMotion is a mobile app that tracks your driving to determine whether or not you have a road
                    rage problem. Stay calm and collected while driving? The app will help you reduce your insurance
                    premiums. The app will film you while driving and look for facial expressions to detect emotion. The
                    emotion data is used to see how calm and collected you can stay while on the road.

                    During the project, I had the opportunity to work with Microsoft Azure Face Emotion Recognition API
                    and Expo for making an iOS app. While other team members worked on creating a Python Flask REST API,
                    which would communicate with the Expo add to calculate insurance premiums.
