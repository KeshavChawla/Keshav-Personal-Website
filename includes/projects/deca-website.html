                    As part of DECA Ontario's Provincial Officer team, I completely overhauled the deca.ca website. The
                    process involved creating a system that would allow the website to showcase the strength of the
                    organization while also making it easy to maintain and edit the long term.
                    <br><br>
                    I experimented with numerous content management systems and design mockups before considering a
                    medium that would scale. Through the process, I worked through the design process, managing web
                    hosting, ensuring security, search engine optimization, spam management, testing, rapid deployment,
                    bug patching, and technical support.
                    <br><br>
                    As of 2018, the DECA Ontario website reaches 200,000+ visitors per year.
